## Notes
<br/>
The following files are needed:
-  avp_huds directory
-  avp_rifs directory
-  fastfile directory
-  language.txt file

   #### ALL FILES AND FOLDERS NEED TO BE LOWERCASE ####

  Includes 2 saves, 100% all missions and all cheats & a default profile with nothing unlocked.
  (both have the controls setup for each species)
