## Notes
<br/>
**For PortMaster version, copy your Shovel Knight Treasure Trove for Linux folder to the ports/shovelknight/gamedata folder.  You should have ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight folder structure with additional subfolders such as 32, 64, and data within ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight.  Once done, just run Shovel Knight.sh.
