On some devices the 'Select' button does not get mapped to 'Esc'.  If you encounter this, use 'L2'.
To invert right joystick look, set mouse-look invert under Options -> Players and Controls -> Customize Controls.  
On some devices 'Select+B' will invoke the menu.

### Game data files needed:

Copy all contents except the 'Bin' folder from your Serious Sam Classic install(s) and DO NOT overwrite existing files.
Use your GOG, Steam, or CD versions.  Serious Sam Classics: Revolution copies of TFE & TSE should work, too.
Copy The First Encounter's contents to /sstfe/
Copy The Second Encounter's contents to /sstse/
