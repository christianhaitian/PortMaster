so ill preface this with im new to this whole github thing and new to coding in general,

General Requests:
1) could someone make a tutorial somewhere on how to make a port for portmaster and what exactly is needed,
 ie. the source code of an existing game, dependencies for such etc.
2) could someone add a place for contact in order for those of us less savvy with code to request any specific ports,
  those with enough interest or those that catch an interested coders eye becoming additions to the project

Game port requests: id make these myself if i knew what i was doing
1) Ikemen-GO - its an opensource port that basically emulates MUGEN (fighting game) and can utilize mugen assets.

2) Freeciv - its an opensource clone of the civilization games.

3) The XTech - its a newer version of supermariobrosx and the source is available.
